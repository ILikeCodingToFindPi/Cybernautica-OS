▶ Patience to decode ancient ciphers
▶ Wisdom to see patterns in chaos  
▶ Courage to dive deeper into the rabbit hole
▶ Intelligence to connect scattered fragments

YOUR FIRST TASK:
Find the hidden directory. The clue lies in the base64 encoded 
message within the .hidden_cipher file.

Decode it. Follow it. Uncover the truth.
